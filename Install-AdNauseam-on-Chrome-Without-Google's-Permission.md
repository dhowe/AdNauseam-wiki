### Using AdNauseam on other browsers

If like us Google have lost your trust, you might want to move to a Chrome based browser that is not as intrusive and controlling. You have many options, like:

* Go back to [Firefox](https://getfirefox.com)
* You've always wanted to [give Opera a chance](https://opera.com), this is a good excuse
* Try one of the many non-Google Chrome versions
