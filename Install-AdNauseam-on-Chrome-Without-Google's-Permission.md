### Using AdNauseam on other browsers

If Google has lost your trust, as it has ours, you might want to move to a browser that is not as intrusive and controlling. You have a number of options including:

* Go back to [Firefox](https://getfirefox.com)
* You've always wanted to [give Opera a chance](https://opera.com), this is a good excuse
* Try one of the many non-Google versions of Chromium (such as [Iron](https://www.srware.net/en/software_srware_iron.php), [Comodo Dragon](https://www.comodo.com/home/browsers-toolbars/browser.php), or [Maxthon](http://www.maxthon.com/))
