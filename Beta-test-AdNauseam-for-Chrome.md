Try our AdNauseam beta for Chrome:

1. download [this file](https://github.com/dhowe/AdNauseam2/files/265044/adnauseam.2.1.13.crx.zip)
2. unzip it
3. drag into ``chrome://extensions/`` page in Chrome

Then give it a spin and if it does anything weird, let us know by [opening an issue here](https://github.com/dhowe/AdNauseam2/issues)
