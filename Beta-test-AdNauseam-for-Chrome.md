Try our AdNauseam beta for Chrome:

1. download and unzip [this file](https://github.com/dhowe/AdNauseam/releases/download/v2.2.0/adnauseam.chromium.zip)
2. drag the folder into the ``chrome://extensions/`` page

Then give it a spin, and if it does anything weird, let us know by [opening an issue here](https://github.com/dhowe/AdNauseam2/issues)
